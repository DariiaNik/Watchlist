            rating: '8.6',

            genre: ['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Sci-Fi'],
            shortDescription: 'Earth\'s future has been riddled by disasters, famines, and droughts. There is only one way to ensure mankinds survival: Interstellar travel. A newly discovered wormhole in the far reaches of our solar system allows a team of astronauts to go where no man has gone before, a planet that may have the right environment to sustain human life.',
            fullDescription: ' In 2067, crop blights and dust storms threaten humanity\'s survival. Cooper, a widowed engineer and former NASA pilot turned farmer, lives with his father-in-law, Donald, his 15-year-old son, Tom Cooper, and 10-year-old daughter, Murphy "Murph" Cooper. After a dust storm, strange dust patterns inexplicably appear in Murphy\'s bedroom; she attributes the anomaly to a ghost. Cooper eventually deduces the patterns were caused by gravity variations and they represent geographic coordinates in binary code. Cooper follows the coordinates to a secret NASA facility headed by Professor John Brand.\n' +

                '48 years earlier, unknown beings positioned a wormhole near Saturn, opening a path to a distant galaxy with 12 potentially habitable worlds located near a black hole named Gargantua. Twelve volunteers traveled through the wormhole to individually survey the planets and three — Dr. Mann, Laura Miller, and Wolf Edmunds — reported positive results. Based on their data, Professor Brand conceived two plans to ensure humanity\'s survival. Plan A involves developing a gravitational propulsion theory to propel settlements into space, while Plan B involves launching the Endurance spacecraft carrying 5,000 frozen human embryos to settle a habitable planet.'
