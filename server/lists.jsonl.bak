There is only one way to ensure mankinds survival: Interstellar travel. A newly discovered wormhole in the far reaches of our solar system allows a team of astronauts to go where no man has gone before, a planet that may have the right environment to sustain human life.","fullDescription":" In 2067, crop blights and dust storms threaten humanity's survival. Cooper, a widowed engineer and former NASA pilot turned farmer, lives with his father-in-law, Donald, his 15-year-old son, Tom Cooper, and 10-year-old daughter, Murphy \"Murph\" Cooper. After a dust storm, strange dust patterns inexplicably appear in Murphy's bedroom; she attributes the anomaly to a ghost. Cooper eventually deduces the patterns were caused by gravity variations and they represent geographic coordinates in binary code. Cooper follows the coordinates to a secret NASA facility headed by Professor John Brand.\n\n48 years earlier, unknown beings positioned a wormhole near Saturn, opening a path to a distant galaxy with 12 potentially habitable worlds located near a black hole named Gargantua. Twelve volunteers traveled through the wormhole to individually survey the planets and three — Dr. Mann, Laura Miller, and Wolf Edmunds — reported positive results. Based on their data, Professor Brand conceived two plans to ensure humanity's survival. Plan A involves developing a gravitational propulsion theory to propel settlements into space, while Plan B involves launching the Endurance spacecraft carrying 5,000 frozen human embryos to settle a habitable planet.","_id":"LtquoQzgxYFevzZv"}
